# WebScappring
--------------
* Guide to Web Scraping
Let's get you started with web scraping and Python. Before we begin, here are some important rules to follow and understand:

Always be respectful and try to get premission to scrape, do not bombard a website with scraping requests, otherwise your IP address may be blocked!
Be aware that websites change often, meaning your code could go from working to totally broken from one day to the next.
Pretty much every web scraping project of interest is a unique and custom job, so try your best to generalize the skills learned here.

* instaling necessary lib in python
```console
$ pip3 install requests
$ pip3 install lxml
$ pip3 install
```
